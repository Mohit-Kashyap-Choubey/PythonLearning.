# 🚀 6-Month Learning Journey  

Hey, I’m Mohit 👋  

I’ve set myself a goal: **in 6 months I want to get really good at Python, SQL, and Excel.**  
Not just tutorials, but actual projects that prove I can use these skills in the real world.  
This repo is where I’ll keep track of everything week by week.  

---

## 🎯 Why I’m doing this  
I want to build a solid foundation in coding and data handling. These three tools are everywhere — whether it’s solving problems, analyzing data, or building small apps.  
This repo will help me stay consistent and show my progress clearly.  

---

## 🗓️ Plan  

- **Month 1–2** → Python basics + small projects 🐍  
- **Month 3–4** → SQL practice + real database projects 💾  
- **Month 5** → Excel for analysis & dashboards 📊  
- **Month 6** → A capstone project that brings everything together 🌟  

---

## ✅ Weekly Log  

- **Week 1** → ATM Simulation in Python (done ✅)  
- **Week 2** → …  
- **Week 3** → …  

I’ll keep adding here as I go.

## 🛠️ Project Ideas  

- **Python:** ATM, calculator, file organizer, maybe even a simple JARVIS-like bot  
- **SQL:** library system, employee database, query challenges  
- **Excel:** dashboards, sales analysis, automation with formulas

## ✨ Closing note  
This isn’t about being perfect — it’s about getting better every week.  
Six months from now, I want this repo to be proof of how far I’ve come.
